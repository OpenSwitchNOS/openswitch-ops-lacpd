## Fallback Disabled and toggle admin flag
### Objective
This test will verify fallback functionality, disabled for this test, that all
interfaces will be `Defaulted and Expired`, no interfaces will be in
`Collecting and Distributing`. For this test the **admin** flag will be toggled
from `up` to `down` and viceversa.

### Requirements
- Physical/Virtual switches
- **CT File**: `ops-tests/component/test_lacpd_ct_lag_fallback.py`

## Fallback Disabled and toggle lacp flag as passive
### Objective
This test will verify fallback functionality, disabled for this test, that all
interfaces will be `Defaulted and Expired`, no interfaces will be in
`Collecting and Distributing`. For this test the **lacp** flag will be toggled
from `[] (cleared value)` to `passive` and viceversa.

**Note**: Both switches cannot be in lacp mode `passive`, it will break the
connectivity and the daemon will manage as if there is no partner connected.

## Fallback Disabled with false flag and toggle lacp flag as passive
### Objective
This test will verify fallback functionality, disabled for this test, that all
interfaces will be `Defaulted and Expired`, no interfaces will be in
`Collecting and Distributing`. For this test there will be set the
`lacp-fallback-ab` flag to `false` and the **lacp** flag will be toggled from
`[] (cleared value)` to `passive` and viceversa.

**Note**: Both switches cannot be in lacp mode `passive`, it will break the
connectivity and the daemon will manage as if there is no partner connected.

### Requirements
- Physical/Virtual switches
- **CT File**: `ops-tests/component/test_lacpd_ct_lag_fallback.py`

Note: The following steps are only executed in switch 1.

*  Check the member interfaces and the lag port bond_status.
*  Turn off 3 of the member interfaces of the LAG.
*  Check the member interfaces and the lag port bond_status.
*  Turn back on the interfaces turned off in step 4.
*  Remove one interface from the LAG.
*  Check the interfaces and the lag port bond_status.
*  Add the interface removed in step 7 back to the LAG.
*  Check the member interfaces and the lag port bond_status.
*  Turn off all the member interfaces of the LAG.
*  Check the member interfaces and the lag port bond_status.
*  Turn on all the member interfaces of the LAG.
*  Remove all the member interfaces of the LAG except by one.
*  Add an interface to the LAG with different configured speed as the interface
   that is already in the LAG, so one interface is not eligible.

### Test result criteria
#### Test pass criteria
- All interfaces state machines on switch 1 fulfill with all the expected flags
enabled when LAG 1 is disabled on switch 2.
- All interfaces state machines fullfil with all the expected flags enabled
when both LAGs 1 are enabled on both switches.
#### Test fail criteria
- At least one interface state machine on switch 1 does not fulfill with all
the expected flags enabled when LAG 1 is disabled on switch 2.
- At least one interface state machine does not fulfill with all the expected
flags enabled when both LAGs 1 are enabled on both switches.


## Enable Fallback mode priority with timeout zero
### Objective
This test will verify that the interface with higher priority must be in
Defaulted and in 'Collecting and Distributing' when fallback is active and
the fallback mode is 'priority'. When the fallback timeout is set to 0, the
interface with higher priority should be in fallback all the time

### Requirements
- Physical/Virtual switches
- **CT File**: `ops-tests/component/test_lacpd_ct_fallback_priority_all_active_modes.py`

## Enable Fallback mode priority toggle lacp mode
### Objective
If in switch 1 and 2, the lacp mode is set to 'off' and then to 'on' the
interface with higher priority must be in Defaulted and in'Collecting and
Distributing' when fallback is active and the fallback mode is 'priority'.
